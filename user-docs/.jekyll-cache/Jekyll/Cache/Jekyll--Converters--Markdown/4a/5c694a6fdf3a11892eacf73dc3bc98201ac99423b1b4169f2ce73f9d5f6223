<p>Learners can participate in an elaastic <a href="/elaastic-questions-server/en/key_concepts/assignments">assignment</a> without having an account
on the platform. They then participate in the activity completely anonymously.</p>

<p>Learners can create an account on the platform using the <a href="https://elaastic.irit.fr/elaastic-questions/register">registration form</a>.

When a learner participates in an assignment by being authenticated, then the teacher in charge of the assignment has the nominative
information about the learner.</p>

<p>In the case of using Elaastic via an online course platform such as Moodle, when a learner starts an elaastic assignment 
for the first time, then an account is created in elaastic automatically with information from that learnerâ€™s Moodle account.<br />
In this configuration, the teacher can access to the nominative information about the participants of an
<a href="/elaastic-questions-server/en/key_concepts/assignments">assignment</a>.</p>
