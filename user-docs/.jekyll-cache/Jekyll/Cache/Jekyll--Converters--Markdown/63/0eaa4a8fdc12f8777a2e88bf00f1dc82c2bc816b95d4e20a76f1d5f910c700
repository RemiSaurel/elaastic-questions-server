<p>This document is a tutorial on how to use the <a href="https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/">Elaastic</a> platform. <a href="https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/">Elaastic</a>
is an online application that facilitates the implementation of formative assessment sequences during a face-to-face or distance learning course.</p>

<p>An <a href="https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/">Elaastic</a> sequence traditionally proceeds as follows:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The teacher asks the students a question.</li>
  <li>Each student responds to the question by providing a written justification and their confidence in the answer.</li>
  <li>Students participate in a confrontation of point of views.</li>
  <li>Students answer the question a second time, possibly modifying their initial answer.</li>
  <li>A discussion between the teacher and the pupils concludes the sequence.</li>
</ol>
