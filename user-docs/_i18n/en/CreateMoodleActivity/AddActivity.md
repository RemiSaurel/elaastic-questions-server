## 7.4. Add an activity

From any section, click on "Add an activity or a resource". In this example, we add our activity in a section called "Section 1".

![Vue sur click course]({{ "images/fr/create_moodle_activity/add_activity.png"| relative_url }})

Click on Elaastic in the list of all the possible activity types.

![Vue sur click course]({{ "images/fr/create_moodle_activity/select_elaastic.png"| relative_url }})

Type the name of your activity. In this example, it will be called "Capital". Click on "Save and go back to the course" to validate the creation of the subject.

![Vue sur click course]({{ "images/fr/create_moodle_activity/activity_form.png"| relative_url }})

The activity is now displayed in the list of the activities of the section.

![Vue sur click course]({{ "images/fr/create_moodle_activity/activity_created.png"| relative_url }})

When you create an Elaastic activity on Moodle as described above, an empty subject with a single assignment is automatically created within Elaastic.
When learners click on the link to the activity, they are redirected to the page of the Elaastic assignment.
As a teacher, on the first click, you'll become the owner of the subject and will be redirected to the page to edit your subject.
