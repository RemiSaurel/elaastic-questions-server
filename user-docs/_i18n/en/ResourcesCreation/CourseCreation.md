## 3.1. Course creation

To create a course, you need to go to the course management page. It can be accessed by clicking on the folder icon on the left menu. It is also the home page.

![Vue sur courses]({{ "../images/en/resources_creation/go_to_course_page.png" | relative_url }})

Once you are on the page to manage your course, click on the green button "Course create".

![Vue sur courses creation 2]({{ "../images/en/resources_creation/courses.png"| relative_url }})

Name your course and click on "Create".

![Vue sur courses creation 3]({{ "../images/en/resources_creation/create_course.png"| relative_url }})

When this is done, you are automatically redirected on the page to edit the course you just created.

![Vue sur courses creation 4]({{ "../images/en/resources_creation/course_created.png"| relative_url }})

Since you've juste created your course, it doesn't contain any subject yet. To see how to create a subject, go to chapter 3.2. of this tutorial.
