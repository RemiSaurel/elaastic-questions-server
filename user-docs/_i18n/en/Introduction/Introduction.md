# Introduction

This document is a tutorial on how to use the [Elaastic](https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/) platform. [Elaastic](https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/)
is an online application that facilitates the implementation of formative assessment sequences during a face-to-face or distance learning course.

An [Elaastic](https://www.irit.fr/elaastic/) sequence traditionally proceeds as follows:

1. The teacher asks the students a question.
2. Each student responds to the question by providing a written justification and their confidence in the answer.
3. Students participate in a confrontation of point of views.
4. Students answer the question a second time, possibly modifying their initial answer.
5. A discussion between the teacher and the pupils concludes the sequence.
